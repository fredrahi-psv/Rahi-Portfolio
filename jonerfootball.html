            <h1>Joner Football</h1>
            <p>I started working at Joner Football in early 2025 as a video editor, videographer, and content creator. My role includes editing videos for YouTube, social media, and the Joner Football App, as well as working creatively to market the brand and improve its reach.</p>
            <p>Joner Football is an private coaching academy that trains players of all ages and abilites, from kids just starting to semi-pro and professional athletes. We use a mix of compact digital cameras, GoPro's, and DJI drones and OSMO Pocket cameras to film coaching sessions and camps.</p>
            <p>The main objective for the content team at Joner Football is to provide educational, accessible, and high quality videos that both players and coaches get value from.</p>
