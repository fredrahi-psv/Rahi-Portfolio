            <h1>CityHub Internship <span class="highlight-box"></span></h1>
            <p>I interned as a writer at CityHub as part of my Macquarie University PACE unit in semester 2 of 2024. I was tasked with writing a news article and an arts and entertainment article each week. The articles were all published online and four of them made it to print in the CityHub monthly magazine.</p>
            <p>During my internship, I learned to engage with different audiences through diverse content and focused on improving my narrative writing. This experience also provided insights into the editorial process and collaboration within a publishing team.</p>
            <p>I CityHub mission of providing relevant and engaging content, which has helped shape my path toward a career in journalism and media.</p>
